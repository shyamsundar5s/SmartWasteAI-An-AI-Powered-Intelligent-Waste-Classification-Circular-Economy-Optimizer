# SmartWasteAI-An-AI-Powered-Intelligent-Waste-Classification-Circular-Economy-Optimizer
SmartWasteAI is an innovative AI-powered waste management system designed to revolutionize how waste is classified, recycled, and reused. By leveraging cutting-edge machine learning and IoT technologies, SmartWasteAI aims to reduce landfill pressure, promote sustainable disposal, and enable a circular economy.

## üí° Problem Statement
Most existing waste management systems fail to effectively classify waste, leading to recyclable materials ending up in landfills and missed opportunities in the circular economy. Manual segregation is labor-intensive, inaccurate, and often impractical, especially in developing regions.
